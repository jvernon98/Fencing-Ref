## Overview
#### A Modern Way of Fencing
Fencing is a sport that requires precision, skill, and strategy. It's an individual and team sport that can be challenging to keep track of scores during tournaments, especially when it involves multiple teams and individuals. Therefore, I am developing a fencing app that helps keep track of team and individual scores during a tournament.

## Features 
1. Tournament setup: The app will allow the user to set up the tournament by creating teams, adding team members, and scheduling matches.
2. Live score tracking: During the tournament, the app will allow users to keep track of scores in real-time. The app will display the scores of each match, and users can input points as they are earned.
3. Team and individual scores: The app will keep track of both team and individual scores, which are updated automatically after each match.
4. Customization: The app allows customization of tournament rules, including the number of points required to win a match and the time limit for each match.
5. Reporting: The app will provide a summary of the tournament, including team and individual scores, match outcomes, and other relevant information. Users can export this information for further analysis or sharing with others.

## Benefits
1. Saves time: The app eliminates the need for manual score tracking, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
2. Increases accuracy: The app ensures that scores are recorded accurately, eliminating the possibility of human error.
3. Enhances user experience: The app provides a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, making it easy to keep track of scores during the tournament.
4. Improves competitiveness: The app allows users to focus on the competition rather than worrying about keeping track of scores, improving the competitiveness of the tournament.
